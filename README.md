# Network-Simulations
A few discrete-event simulations I implemented for a networking course. I used Python with SimPy

Each folder includes a complete analysis of a networking topic. For each topic, I included;
  - Description of the problem
  - Simulation Scripts
  - Report, including the commentary on the results and the implementation phase
  - Resultant graphs and numerical simulation results (if relevant)

It is really difficult to get started with discrete event simulations. The programming mentality is quite different
than many other programming tasks and even though it is a fantastic library, SimPy lacks a detailed documentation. 
This collection is intended to be a starting point for network simulations. 

As an additional guide, the following article is highly recommended for understanding the generators in Python,
which are the core of these sorts of simulations:
