# Network-Simulations
A few discrete-event simulations I implemented for a networking course. I used Python with SimPy

Each folders includes a complete analysis of a networking topic. The provided files are;
  - Description of the problem
  - Simulation Scripts
  - Report, including the commentary on the results implementation phase
  - Resultant graphs and simulation results (if relevant)

It is really hard to get started in discrete event simulations. The programming mentality is much more different
than many other tasks and even though it is a fantastic library, SimPy lacks a detailed documentation. This collection
is intended to be a starting point for network simulations. 

As an additional guide, the following article is highly recommended for understanding the generators in Python,
which happen to be the core of these sorts of simulations:
